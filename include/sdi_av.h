 * SDI frame contract of our V4L2 capture and playout drivers: one SDI frame
 * of one port in a single multi-planar V4L2 buffer -- the active picture,
 * the audio of that frame, the ancillary data packets, the vertical
 * blanking lines and per-frame metadata. This file is the same, byte for
 * byte, in every driver that follows the contract and in the client, so a
 * client reads and writes any card with one piece of code. Nothing here
 * belongs to one vendor: the card is named by QUERYCAP (driver, card,
 * bus_info) and the media controller, and by the vendor tail of the
 * metadata when it has something of its own to tell.
 *
 * A capture node is VIDEO_CAPTURE_MPLANE, a playout node VIDEO_OUTPUT_MPLANE,
 * both with the same five planes and the same layout of each; ENUM_FMT says
 * which pixel formats a node offers, G_DV_TIMINGS the geometry of the frame,
 * ENUMINPUT.status and V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE the state of the input.
 * A 1000/1001 rate is the CEA-861 timings of the whole rate with
 * V4L2_DV_FL_REDUCED_FPS and the nominal pixel clock, the way
 * v4l2_calc_timeperframe() reads it; a driver also takes the clock already
 * divided by 1.001, and flags it the same.

 * audio_samples in the metadata counts, field by field: samples in
 * bytesused beyond that count are padding and are not played. Without
 * metadata, with audio_samples of zero, or counting more than bytesused
 * holds, the driver takes bytesused as the audio and halves it between the
 * fields. A field holds 48000 / field rate samples, rounded up on the

/*
 * Metadata plane: one struct sdi_meta per frame. The plane opens with the
 * magic, so a client can tell the buffer follows this contract without
 * asking QUERYCAP, and the version of the layout. The common part is
 * exactly SDI_META_SIZE bytes; fields are only ever added into reserved[],
 * any other change is a new version. Its last three words are the vendor
 * tail: vendor_magic names the card, a fourcc of the driver's choosing (0
 * when the card does not name itself); vendor_bytes is the length of the
 * vendor block that follows the common part (0: no block, and the plane is
 * exactly SDI_META_SIZE bytes); vendor_version the layout version of that
 * block. The vendor block is how a card tells what the common part has no
 * place for: a structure of the driver's own, declared in the driver, not
 * here, with fields only ever appended; a client reads it only knowing the
 * (vendor_magic, vendor_version) pair, and no further than it knows. A
 * client that does not know the pair reads the common part and skips the
 * block. Version 4 gave the metadata this common layout with one magic for
 * every card and the vendor tail; version 3 added the VBI plane and took
 * out of the metadata what V4L2 already says about the buffer:
 *
 *   v4l2_buffer.sequence   the card's frame counter (capture) or the number
 *                          of frames sent before this one, repeats included
 *                          (output): a gap of n is n frames lost, or the
 *                          previous frame sent again n times
 *   v4l2_buffer.timestamp  CLOCK_MONOTONIC of the frame event (capture) or
 *                          of the moment the card took the frame (output)
 *   V4L2_BUF_FLAG_ERROR    the frame is not to be trusted
 *   G_DV_TIMINGS           the frame geometry (total and active lines)
 *   ENUMINPUT.status and V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE  the input state
 *   plane 2                the SMPTE 352 payload identifier, as an ANC packet
 *
 * What is left is what V4L2 has no place for. A card without a clock of its
 * own puts 0 in hw_timestamp; a card that does not check line CRCs puts 0 in
 * crc_errors.
 *
 * Output: the client fills magic, version, flags and audio_samples, the rest
 * zero (vendor tail included, unless the driver documents a block it takes);
 * a plane with another magic or version is not read and the frame goes
 * without it (the audio is halved between the fields). Of the flags a
 * playout node takes SDI_F_REC2020, SDI_F_HLG, SDI_F_PQ and SDI_F_LEVEL_B
 * as a statement about that one frame; the rest tell what was received and
 * mean nothing on the way out. A frame setting none of the three colour
 * flags goes out with the colorimetry and the transfer characteristic the
 * node itself is set to, and one without SDI_F_LEVEL_B with the 3G mapping
 * the node itself is set to, so a client that states nothing changes
 * nothing. A card that cannot change one of them between frames keeps its
 * own setting and says so in the driver's documentation. On return the
 * driver fills hw_timestamp with the card time at which it took the frame,
 * when the card has a clock.
